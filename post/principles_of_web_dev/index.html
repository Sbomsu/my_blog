<p>Websites have changed tremendously throughout the years. The very first websites were designed in the 1990s, it was used by scientist in research in to share recommendations between each other. Since then designers have been applying several approaches to change the way website look and feel.</p>
<p>Early websites were entirely text-based with limited graphic user interface and no real layout other than headings and paragraphs. The websites had only hypertext and hyperlinks as a method of navigating through text. In the present time, website can still share ideas but the web has evolved into a tool needed for the society to properly as it is ingrained into fabric of many industries. The industry has moved on in leaps and bounds since those days, bringing us table-based, Flash and then CSS designs along the way.</p>
<h2 id="purpose-of-the-websites">PURPOSE OF THE WEBSITES</h2>
<p>Website are now so much more than simple links that provide information. For example, my current blog website will have content such as embed video clips such as youtube clips, images and links to other relevant website that contain information about the principles of computer science. Other websites that run businesses, compete with each other to get you view their product therefore web designers need to understand the purpose of website design so they can make websites that are most importantly fit for purpose, fits the theme(colour theme), genre but also stand out in viewers minds for the right reasons. Businesses that are in very saturated and competitive industry choose to hire digital marketing agencies on their own behalf to attract viewers.</p>
<p>Websites have different purpose and perform different functions. Originally, websites were used provides information, However content based technology called Web 2.0 has been developed to allow users to interact and add their content, knowledge and opinions. Here are some of the following development enabled by Web 2.0 technology:</p>
<p><strong>Blogs</strong> - If you're currently on this website then, you are on blog website. Blogs are online journals that include tools for the reader to comment and contribute. Everyone can become a blogger and create a blog, most of which are available online publicly but there are private ones that can viewed by people permitted by the blogger.</p>
<p><strong>Social networking</strong> - These websites allow people to connect with their friends, family, and coworkers. Users may exchange updates, images, and life events to build personal relationships and stay connected across distances.<br />
 Social networking websites facilitate the formation and maintenance of groups based on common interests, hobbies, or goals. Groups and forums on these platforms enable users to locate and interact with others who share their interests.Examples of social networking websites are <a href="https://www.instagram.com">Instagram </a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/">TikTok</a>, <a href="https://www.gumtree.com/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwmrqzBhAoEiwAXVpgos1TeyhYvxm6kfxcnP6xTEGZKdXSCcjzBB6InhDHc37H4d-sTzD92BoC8PkQAvD_BwE">Gumtree</a> etc. each of these website unique selling point to its users as the user interface alone can attract or detract users. For example, user on gumtree know it to be a platform for specialist buying and selling functionality to facilitate safe and successful trading.</p>
<h2 id="key-requirement-of-all-websites"><strong>KEY REQUIREMENT OF ALL WEBSITES.</strong></h2>
<p>The following are the key requirements of all websites.</p>
<p><strong>User-Friendly</strong> - It  is easy to use and understand. Understanding how to produce a user-friendly website will improve the way visitors are able to interact and use your website in terms of layout,design and the content.</p>
<p><strong>Consistency</strong>  - To get a consistent appearance and feel, use the same layout, colour scheme, font, and images throughout the site. Ensure that logos, brand colours, and other branding components are applied consistently throughout the website. If you take a look at the <a href="https://www.lsec.ac.uk/">London south-east college website</a> it matches its brand colours and theme. Maintain a consistent tone and style in your writing, making sure that headings, subheaders, and body content all follow the same pattern. </p>
<p>Standardise the design of interactive components such as buttons, links, and forms to ensure that users know how to engage with them on different sites. Use a consistent grid system and spacing guidelines to guarantee that components are placed uniformly on the page.<br />
Place navigation menus, footers, and other repeating components in the same place on each page.</p>
<p><strong>Navigation</strong> - It is important to provide a well-organized, simple primary navigation menu that allows users to swiftly discover the website's important areas. Use navigation to display visitors' present location within the site structure and allow for easy retracing.<br />
 A search bar will help people rapidly discover certain content on the website.  Ensure that all links are easily discernible and clickable, with informative anchor text indicating the destination. Consistent navigation labels throughout the site to reduce any misunderstanding.</p>
<p>The requirement needed for all websites have been broken by Wes Mcdowell on Youtube. In this youtube clip he explains the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c2d-J3ZqnI&t=92s&ab_channel=WesMcDowell">8 must-have for a high website.</a></p>
<h2 id="principles-of-web-design">PRINCIPLES OF WEB DESIGN</h2>
<p><img src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/web-design-principles-1024x512.jpg" alt="webdev" /></p>
<p>Millions of websites are built on a daily basis, so the principles of a good website design is crucial to attract visitors. This allows the website the opportunity to be successful in a market which is very competitive. It is important to note today's world even with a good principled web design you might need advertisement to attract visitors. With a bad principled website advertisement will not  be effective to its potential because visitors will not enjoy a good experience as explained by in this video titled "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3UjkL2h2S0&ab_channel=LYFEMarketing">Every Way To Get Traffic To Your Website In 2024".</a>
.
A smart website efficiently includes the following components to improve user experience and engagement:  </p>
<p><strong>Side Layout:</strong> This means giving consideration to where elements go on a web page and how content will be spread across a website. it organises material and improves navigation, making it easier for consumers to discover what they need.  </p>
<p><strong>White spacing:</strong> This is the space on web page that is left untouched and white. This improves readability and concentration, resulting in a clean and professional design. 
Unless you utilise spacing, your web pages will look cluttered and messy,and it would be hard for visitors to interpret which words relate to which images and understand what they are looking at. Therefore, when designing a web page it is crucial to use spacing between elements so as to not overwhelm and confuse website users.</p>
<p><strong>Usability:</strong> This is the ease of use of a website, which is how user-friendly it is.An important element of website usability is ensuring that websites content is flexible and works on all browsers and devices. This makes the website is simple to use, accessible, and functioning on all devices, which increases overall user happiness.  </p>
